🕹️ How to Play
The Objective: Find all 8 data pairs (Hex Code + Color Name) to complete the breach.

The Grid: Click on cards to reveal their hidden data.

The Challenge: You aren't just matching identical images; you must match the Hex Value (e.g., #FF0000) to its Human-Readable Name (e.g., Red).

Constraints:

Hack Strength: Every mismatch drains your strength by 10. If it hits 0, the connection is lost.

System Lockout: You have 60 seconds to finish the hack before the system shuts you down.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure for the hacking interface.

CSS3: Custom animations, Flexbox/Grid layouts, and a "Matrix-style" neon aesthetic.

JavaScript (ES6): Game logic, state management, and DOM manipulation.

✨ Key Features
Dynamic Grid Generation: Randomized card placement every session.

Visual Feedback: Custom CSS animations for successful matches (glow) and failed attempts (glitch).

Persistent High Scores: Your highest security breach is saved to localStorage.

Responsive UI: Cyberpunk-themed header showing real-time stats (Hack Strength, Data Packets, and Timer).
